## Certification Criteria

To achieve certification in each skill, the following criteria must be met:

1. Demonstrate the skills through real-world tasks, practical tests, or simulations.
2. Provide evidence of understanding and application through a supervisor review or a verified checklist.

### Contra-Certification Examples

Below are examples of errors that result in non-certification for each skill:

1. **Line Clearances and Work Preparations**
   - Starting work without clearing unnecessary items.
   - Neglecting to verify required tools, materials, or safety measures.
   - Skipping workspace or equipment inspections.

2. **Dexterity in General Tasks**
   - Mishandling tools or components during assembly.
   - Over-tightening or misaligning parts.
   - Poor posture or hand positions causing inefficiency.

3. **Dexterity in Microscopic Work**
   - Struggling to steady hands while working under a microscope.
   - Misaligning components due to lack of control or focus.
   - Damaging delicate parts through excessive force.

4. **Proficiency with Tools and Equipment**
   - Using incorrect tools, causing damage or inefficiency.
   - Failing to assemble or operate equipment correctly.
   - Neglecting to maintain or clean tools, leading to performance issues.

5. **Accuracy in Using Calipers**
   - Misreading measurements, resulting in incorrect dimensions.
   - Forgetting to zero the calipers before use.
   - Using too much force, damaging the calipers or parts.

6. **Competence in Wire Harnessing and Soldering**
   - Producing weak or cold solder joints.
   - Misrouting wires, causing shorts or improper insulation.
   - Overheating components during soldering.

7. **Interpreting Technical and Electrical Diagrams**
   - Misinterpreting symbols or instructions in diagrams.
   - Skipping important notes, causing oversights.
   - Confusing similar symbols, leading to improper connections.

8. **Precision in Following Complex Written Instructions**
   - Skipping steps in instructions due to overconfidence.
   - Misinterpreting technical terms, causing errors.
   - Failing to double-check work, leading to incomplete tasks.

9. **Comprehensive Documentation and Accurate Labeling**
   - Filling out work forms illegibly or with incomplete information.
   - Mislabeling parts, causing workflow confusion.
   - Skipping labels or failing to follow guidelines, resulting in lost parts.

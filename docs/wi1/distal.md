# 7.2 Assembly of XXXX Components

### 7.2.1
Insert a **confidentially-sized guide wire** through the distal end of the central lumen.

### 7.2.2
Strip approximately **confidential length** of the proximal end of **part item XXX** outer jacket using a blade tool.

### 7.2.3
Separate the outer shielding wires from the insulating layer by pulling off the insulator. Cut a portion of the outer shielding wires near the stripped edge of the outer jacket using wire cutters. Hold the remaining shielding wires with tweezers and twist them tightly by rotating the outer jacket with the opposite hand.

### 7.2.4
Strip the insulating layer of each colored **part item YYY** using a blade tool to expose approximately **confidential length**, measuring from the edge of the colored outer jacket.

### 7.2.5
Apply a thin layer of solder paste to the outer and center wires using a spatula. Tin the outer and center wires using a soldering system with a chisel tip set to **confidential temperature**.

**Figure 3**: Example of part item XXX.

### 7.2.6
Place the **component subassembly** on an aluminum base plate with double-sided tape. Cut the lower section of the subassembly with a blade tool and double-edged blade.


**Figure 4**: Component subassembly with lower section indicated.

### 7.2.7
Place the pre-tinned outer conductor wires over the ground pad. Solder the wires to the ground pad using a soldering system with a chisel tip set to **confidential temperature**. Apply flux as necessary for good solder wetting. Clean flux residue with isopropyl alcohol.

### 7.2.8
Bring the exposed center wires over the signal pad. Ensure the center wires do not join with the outer shielding wires during soldering. Solder the center wires to the signal pad using a soldering system set to **confidential temperature**. A low-profile connection between **part item XXX** and the component subassembly is preferred (see Table 2). Apply flux as necessary for good solder wetting. Clean flux residue with isopropyl alcohol.

> **Note:** Do not allow the insulating layer to obstruct the outer wires.

### 7.2.9
Repeat steps 7.2.7 through 7.2.8 for the remaining **part item XXX** components (e.g., Items PTE-0200 to PTE-0206). Take care to avoid entangling the components during this operation.

### 7.2.10
In-process inspection: Inspect each subassembly for soldering quality per Table 1.
